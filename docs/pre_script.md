Here is our AI-powered digital synthesizer!
It has a display of three channels, each channel has control over volume, an envlope, a filter, and a reverb.
The default sound is a saw wave with some medium attack and a long release, here it is.
# OP1
We can tune the attack using the knob, creating a pluck noise.
# OP2
We can also tune the filters when playing the sound, making a reatime FX effect.
# OP3
We can even add the reverb to make a huge-delayed noise.
# OP4


You may ask, what if I want to have a preset that sounds like a voilin? I don't know how to tune it!
Then, you can press the AI button, enter the AI mode, and tell it to generate the sound!
# OP5

That's awesome!
We also have a playback button. Press it to start recording your cool sound!
# OP6
Press again to stop recording. Then, give another press to play your recording!

Really cool, right? This is our AI-powered digital synthesizer! Thanks for watching!
